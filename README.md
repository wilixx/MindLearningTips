# MindLearningTips

THis is some ideas about life-learning written by myself,I hold that seeking is the best thing in our lives.

A Chinese philosopher once said:"吾生而有涯而知也无涯".

What does the learning really means and what should we new generation do, is a huge problems anyway.

I hope every single one can be easy to learn and get skills and no more like a machine through all his or her life.

That is something we should find the key and never put second place.

And I believe this would help all the people in the in-coming future.

Life is limited,how far can we go and how many achievements can we make,that is what I am concerned about in my free time.
